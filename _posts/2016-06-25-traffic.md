This map shows the average speed in the rough geographic area of my commute.  I built this visualization to explore good routes to get to the office.  This shows the data collected from waze over a month.

In terms of low hanging fruit with this dataset, I found that I am happy leaving around 7-8am to limit dealing with too much traffic.  Likewise, the return commute is much larger than I expected going from 4pm past 8pm.
