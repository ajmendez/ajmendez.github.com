Here I map the ratio of addresses in each country to the total population of each country.  This gives a rough "corruption index" to highlight countries that have many more offshore accounts relative to the size of each country. These countries shown in black like the British Virgin Islands or Niue may have laws conducive to storing money in their banks whereas lighter countries are not well connected to the panama papers or have stricter laws. Country populations are from worlddata.info. For countries and antarctica with a limited number of addresses in the Panama Papers or with an unknown population are shown in a light blue.
