  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I am a postdoctoral scholar at Johns Hopkins University 
      working on large data-sets in observational astrophysics.
      Prior to this appointment I was a graduate-student in at the 
      University of California San Diego: Center for Astrophysics and 
      Space Sciences. I study the 
      multi-wavelength morphological properties of galaxies and Active Galactic 
      Nuceli (AGN) using large redshift-surveys at z~1. I am especially 
      interested in building and using large datasets to further our 
      understanding of the relationship between gas and star-formation, 
      and AGN in galaxy evolution. 
   </p>
   <p>I graduated from the University of Washington in 2008 with Bachelor of 
       Science degrees in Astronomy, Mathematics, and Physics. <p>


<p>In addition to astronomy and physics, I enjoy photography, hiking, biking, 
    programming, and building micro-controlled robots.</p>
