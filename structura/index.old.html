                <p>This website presents a visualization of the night sky, going back to the big bang.
                    It shows the structure of stars, galaxies, and super massive black holes.
                    The video starts with the Apache point observatory (APO) where the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) astronomical observations take place.
                    SDSS observed a quarter of the sky, and covers most of what you could see on a clear night, if you had a million times more sensitive eyes.
                    After looking at APO, the video shows the structure of the universe through a window the size of the sky.
                    The bottom of the video is flat and aimed at the horizon, and the curved top angles towards directly above your head.
                    The rotation of the earth is removed and focuses on just a single direction in the sky.
                    This video guides you though the five different epochs, stars, galaxies, quasars, the dark ages, and finally the cosmic microwave background as you go back in time to the big bang.
                    Here we describe the basic properties of each epoch that this video contains:</p>

                    <div class='about-content'>
                        <h3>Stars in The Milky Way </h3>
                        <div class='col-lg-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12 pull-right about-img-right'>
                            <img src="img/about/stars.png" alt="" class="img-rounded about-img">
                        </div>
                        <p>Depending on where were you are located, you may only see a few stars in the night sky.
                            Whereas, far away from city lights you can see many thousands covering the sky.
                            These stars are located within the Milky way, the galaxy which we are located, and span a large range of masses, luminosities, and distances.
                            The human eye is limited to around 6th magnitude stars, and the video quickly moves past this, and uses the sensitivity of telescopes to show fainter stars than we would be able to see.
                            These stars are both farther away and also less massive, both of which causing them to appear to be fainter.
                            This video just shows you the tip of the proverbial iceberg, with many more fainter stars that are not shown and even more that have yet to be detected.
                        </p>
                        <p>Most may wonder where is the plane of the Milky way.
                            The larger concentration of stars found in the plane is just outside of this window.
                            We choose to look away from the huge concentration of stars found in the plane so that we can more easily see out of our own galaxy.
                            To get some idea of where the galaxy is located, look at this <a href="http://legacysurvey.org/viewer/?ra=180&dec=40&zoom=2&layer=sdssco">map</a> from Dustin Lang.
                            It shows a flat image of all of the sources that we are going to divide up up into stars, galaxies, and quasars.

                        <p>Moving past the stars within the Milky way, we find many of these galaxies in a giant web-like structure that span across the sky. 
                            These galaxies might remind you of the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/news/earth-at-night.html#.VrDjyFMrKrw">earth at night</a>, where the bright city and highway lights paint interesting structures on the earth.
                            Similarly, what we see are the bright points of light from galaxies which are painted within the deep dark-matter landscape of the universe.
                            The structures that are painted by galaxies be grouped into filaments (highways) and clusters (cities) with both due to the gravitational collapse of matter over time.</p>
                        <p>At first the galaxies that you see are large enough for telescope to capture the exquisit morphology (shape) of their stars like the picture to the right.
                            The population of stars within each galaxy gives them different colors, with galaxies forming many new stars being very blue, and older elliptical galaxies being more yellow or red.
                            For this visualization we color each galaxy by the color you would see them as if your eyes were sensitive enough, which roughly translates to how many stars the galaxy is forming out of the gas within each galaxy.
                            The size of each galaxy is limited to the resolution of the human eye, making each frame mimic what you would see if you could see a million times fainter.</p>
                        <p>Slowly marching back in time, we find that the appearance of this structure shrinks. 
                            Similar to a person standing next to you and that same person walking down a field away away from you, these structures have very similar structure at all of these redshifts. 
                        </p>
                        <p>As we increase the speed backwards that the visualization goes, we start seeing more red galaxies. 
                            These sources were targeted and observed to give astronomers a large sample of similar galaxies to measure the shape of the universe.
                            Using all of the galaxies together, astronomers measured the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations.

                            Around half the age of the universe (7 billion years ago) we find a dramatic disappearance of the very red galaxies and an appearance of blue points.
                            These blue points show galaxies where the violent consumption of gas by the super massive black holes (SMBH) found at the centers of galaxies outshines the galaxy itself.
                            As the gas spirals down onto the black hole it heats up and gives off tremendous amounts of light allowing astronomers to far into the past.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just past ten billion years ago, at a redshift of 2 there is a significant increase in the number of quasars shown in the video.
                            These sources were specifically targeted by the SDSS-III/BOSS mission to be used as distant laser beams to measure the universe as their photons stream across it.
                            Similar to the laser beams protecting vaults in spy movies, when gas is in front of the beam we can detect its presence.
                            By measuring the distribution of the gas, specifically the Lyman-alpha forest, we then can infer the shape and structure of the universe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Around 12 billion years ago, just past a redshift of 3.4, the quasars all look very different.  
                            The component of the light from the quasar that dominates their light moves is redshifted out of the filter.

                        <p>During this epoch of the universe we do have much to show. 
                            Galaxies and quasars are hidden by the neutral hydrogen gas which captures their light.
                            The capture of this light causes the universe to become re-ionized allowing us to see the structure in the previous part of this visualization.
                            During this epoch of the universe the first stars started to form and convert hydrogen or helium into light.
                            Understanding these objects is at the forefront of astronomy.

                            The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shows the first snapshot of the structure of the universe.
                            This picture shows the small deviations in the density a few hundred-thousand years after the big bang.
                            The blue patches show regions of the sky where there was slightly fewer atoms and electrons, and the orange regions show slightly more.
                            It is from these small over- and under- densities that gravitationally collapses over the age of the universe to from the structure in this visualization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today we can still detect the photons coming from the CMB after many billion years by very special instruments.
                            To be able to see these phonons you would need very sensitive microwave eyes many billion times more sensitive than your own eyes.</

                              The abrupt changes in color at z~0.8, z~2.6 are due to changes in the targeted sample.
                              We vary the size of each object for clarity of the presentation.</p>
